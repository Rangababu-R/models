This repository is a collaborative effort to develop agnostic data 
models and APIs for managing traffic generators using a `model first` approach.

The focus of this repository is the following:
- modeling best practices
- consistent set of OpenAPI vendor-neutral data and API models
- continuous build process that consolidates all model files into 
a single openapi.yaml document and then validates the document

## Contributing
The open-traffic-generator organization welcomes new members to join this open
