This repository is a collaborative effort to develop agnostic data 
models and APIs for managing traffic generators using a `model first` approach.

The focus of this repository is the following:
- modeling best practices
- consistent set of OpenAPI vendor-neutral data and API models
- continuous build process that consolidates all model files into 
a single openapi.yaml document and then validates the document

The models in this repo are under development and are subject to change, especially the models under the ‘device’ node.  All efforts will be made to keep them backwards compatible.

## Contributing
The open-traffic-generator organization welcomes new members to join this open
source community project and contribute to its development.
