        distinguisher:
          description: >-
            Identifies the policy in the context of (color and endpoint) tuple. 
            It is used by the SR Policy originator to make unique multiple 
            occurrences of the same SR Policy.
          type: integer
          default: 1
        color:
          description: >-
            Identifies the policy. It is used to match the color of the 
            destination prefixes to steer traffic into the SR Policy. 
          type: integer
          default: 100
        ipv6_endpoint:
          description: >-
            Specifies a single node or a set of nodes (e.g., an anycast
            address). It is selected on the basis of the SR Policy type (AFI).

            Mode for choosing the NextHop in MP REACH NLRI. Available modes are :
            Local IP: Automatically fills the Nexthop with the Local IP of the BGP peer.
            For IPv6 BGP peer the Nexthop Encoding capability should be enabled.
            Manual: Override the Nexthop with any arbitrary IPv4/IPv6 address.

            The IPv4 address of the next hop if the Nexthop Mode is manual and
