        This contains the configuration of how to include the Local AS in the AS path
        attribute of the MP REACH NLRI. It also contains optional configuration of additional
        AS Path Segments that can be included in the AS Path attribute.
        The AS Path consists of a Set or Sequence of Autonomous Systems (AS) numbers 
        that a route passes through to reach the destination.

            For iBGP sessions, the value should be kept as "Do Not Include".
            For eBGP sessions, any any one of the other choices should be selected
            except "Do Not Include".

            AS sequence is the most common type of AS_PATH, it contains the 
            list of ASNs starting with the most recent ASN being added read 
            from left to right.

            The other three AS_PATH types are used for Confederations
            - AS_SET is the type of AS_PATH attribute that summarizes routes using
            using the aggregate-address command, allowing AS_PATHs to be 
            summarized in the update as well.
            - AS_CONFED_SEQ gives the list of ASNs in the path starting with the 
            most recent ASN to be added reading left to right
            - AS_CONFED_SET will allow summarization of multiple AS PATHs to be 
            sent in BGP Updates.
