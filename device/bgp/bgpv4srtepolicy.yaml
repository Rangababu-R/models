        distinguisher:
          description: >-
            Identifies the SR policy in the context of <Color, Endpoint> tuple. 
            It is used by the SR Policy originator to make unique multiple 
            occurrences of the same SR Policy as well as candidate paths of
            different SR Policies.
          type: integer
          default: 1
        color:
          description: >-
            Policy color is used to match the color of the destination
            prefixes to steer traffic into the SR Policy.
          type: integer
          default: 100
        ipv4_endpoint:
          description: >-
            Specifies a single node or a set of nodes (e.g., an anycast
            address). It is selected on the basis of the SR Policy type (AFI).

        next_hop_mode:
          description: >-
            Specify the NextHop in MP REACH NLRI. The mode for setting the IP address 
            of the NextHop in the MP REACH NLRI can be one of the following:
              Local IP: Automatically fills the Nexthop with the Local IP of the BGP peer.
              If BGP peer is of type IPv6, Nexthop Encoding capability should be enabled.
              Manual: Override the Nexthop with any arbitrary IPv4/IPv6 address.   
          type: string

        next_hop_address_type:

            If the Nexthop Mode is Manual, it sets the type of the NextHop IP address.

        next_hop_ipv4_address:

            The IPv4 address of the next hop if the Nexthop Mode is manual and
            the Nexthop type is IPv4. If BGP peer is of type IPv6, Nexthop Encoding
            capability should be enabled.
