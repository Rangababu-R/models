    Rsvp.SessionAttribute:
      description: >-
        Configuration for RSVP-TE SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object included in Path Messages. 
      type: object
      properties:
        auto_generate_session_name:
          description: >-
            If this is enabled, an auto-generated Session Name is included in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object in the Path Message for this LSP.
            It is suggested to include the Local IP, Remote IP, Tunnel ID and LSP ID in the auto-generated Session Name to ensure uniqueness of the name in the test.
          type: boolean
          default: true
        session_name:
          description: >-
            If auto_generate_session_name is set to false, then the value of this field is used to fill the Session Name field.
          type: string
        setup_priority:
          description: >-
            Specifies the value of the Setup Priority field. This controls whether the LSP should pre-empt existing 
            LSP setup with certain Holding Priority if resource limitation is encountered when setting up the LSP. (e.g bandwidth availability)
          type: integer
          format: int
          default: 7
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 255
        holding_priority:
          description: >-
            Specifies the value of the Holding Priority field. This controls whether a new LSP being created with certain Setup Priority
            should pre-empt this LSP if resource limitation is encountered when setting up the LSP. (e.g bandwidth availability)
          type: integer
          format: int
          default: 7
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 255
        local_protection_desired:
          description: >-
            This flag permits transit routers to use a local repair mechanism which may result in violation of the explicit
            route object.  When a fault is detected on an adjacent downstream link or node, a transit router can reroute
            traffic for fast service restoration.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        label_recording_desired:
          description: >-
            This flag indicates that label information should be included when doing a route record.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        se_style_desired:
          description: >-
            This flag indicates that the tunnel ingress node may choose to reroute this tunnel without tearing it down.
            A tunnel egress node SHOULD use the SE Style when responding with a Resv message.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        bandwidth_protection_desired:
          description: >-
            This flag indicates to the PLRs along the protected LSP path that a backup path with a bandwidth guarantee is desired.  
            The bandwidth to be guaranteed is that of the protected LSP, if no FAST_REROUTE object is included in the PATH message;
            if a FAST_REROUTE object is in the PATH message, then the bandwidth specified therein is to be guaranteed.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        node_protection_desired:
          description: >-
            This flag indicates to the PLRs along a protected LSP path that a backup path that bypasses at least the next node of the
            protected LSP is desired.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        exclude_any:

            A 32-bit vector representing a set of attribute filters associated with a tunnel all of which must be present for a
