    Rsvp.SessionAttribute:
      description: >-
        Configuration for RSVP-TE SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object included in Path Messages as defined in RFC3209.
        The bandwidth_protection_desired and node_protection_desired flags are defined in RFC4090 (Fast Reroute).
      type: object
      properties:
        auto_generate_session_name:
          description: >-
            If this is enabled, an auto-generated Session Name is included in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object in the Path Message for this LSP.
            It is suggested to include the Local IP, Remote IP, Tunnel ID and LSP ID in the auto-generated Session Name to ensure uniqueness of the name in the test.
          type: boolean
          default: true
        session_name:
          description: >-
            If auto_generate_session_name is set to 'false', then the value of this field is used to fill the Session Name field.
          type: string
        setup_priority:
          description: >-
            Specifies the value of the Setup Priority field. This controls whether the LSP should pre-empt existing 
            LSP setup with certain Holding Priority if resource limitation is encountered when setting up the LSP. (e.g. bandwidth availability)
          type: integer
          default: 7
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 7
        holding_priority:
          description: >-
            Specifies the value of the Holding Priority field. This controls whether a new LSP being created with certain Setup Priority
            should pre-empt this LSP if resource limitation is encountered when setting up the LSP. (e.g. bandwidth availability)
          type: integer
          default: 7
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 7
        local_protection_desired:
          description: >-
            This flag permits transit routers to use a local repair mechanism which may result in violation of the explicit
            route object.  When a fault is detected on an adjacent downstream link or node, a transit router can reroute
            traffic for fast service restoration.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        label_recording_desired:
          description: >-
            This flag indicates that label information should be included when doing a route record.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        se_style_desired:
          description: >-
            This flag indicates that the tunnel ingress node may choose to reroute this tunnel without tearing it down.
            A tunnel egress node SHOULD use the SE Style when responding with a Resv message.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        bandwidth_protection_desired:
          description: >-
            This flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object in the Path Message indicates to the PLRs along the protected LSP path that a 
            backup path with a bandwidth guarantee is desired.  
            This bandwidth has to be guaranteed for the protected LSP, if no FAST_REROUTE object is included in the PATH message.
            If a FAST_REROUTE object is present in the Path message, then the bandwidth specified therein is to be guaranteed.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        node_protection_desired:
          description: >-
            This flag in the SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object in the Path Message indicates to the PLRs along a protected LSP path that
            it is desired to have a backup path that bypasses at least the next node of the protected LSP.
          type: boolean
          default: false
        resource_affinities:
          description: |-
            This is an optional object. If included the extended SESSION_ATTRIBUTE object is sent in the Path message containing 
            the additional fields included in this object. This contain a set of three bitmaps using which further constraints can be
            set on the path calculated for the LSP based on the Admin Group settings in the IGP (e.g ISIS or OSPF interface).
