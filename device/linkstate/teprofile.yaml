        A container for Traffic Engineering properties on a interface.
      type: object
      properties:
        administrative_group:
          description: |-
            The Administrative group sub-TLV (sub-TLV 3). It is a 4-octet 
            user-defined bit mask used to assign administrative group numbers 
            to the interface, for use in assigning colors and resource classes. 
            Each set bit corresponds to a single administrative group for this 
            interface. The settings translate into Group numbers, which range 
            from 0 to 31 (integers).
