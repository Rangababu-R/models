            By convention, the existing Administrative Group sub-TLVs are
            numbered 0 (least significant bit) to 31 (most significant bit).  The
            EAG values are a superset of AG.  That is, bits 0-31 in the EAG have
            the same meaning and MUST have the same values as an AG flooded for
            the same link.  If an EAG's length is more than 4 bytes, numbering
            for these additional bytes picks up where the previous byte left off.
            For example, the least significant bit in the fifth byte of an 8-byte
            EAG is referred to as bit 32.
