        enable_attached_bit:
          description: >-
            If the Attached bit is enabled, it indicates that the ISIS router is attached to another area 
            or the Level 2 backbone. The purpose of an Attached-Bit is to accomplish Inter-Area Routing. 
            When an L1/L2 router is connected to more than one area, it sets the Attached-bit on its L1 LSP.
            This can cause a default route ( 0.0.0.0/0 ) to be installed by the receiving router.
          type: boolean
          default: true
