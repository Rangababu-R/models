            Defines the Up/Down (Redistribution) bit defined for TLVs 128 and 130 by RFC 2966. 
            It is used for domain-wide advertisement of prefix information. 
              Up (0)-used when a prefix is initially advertised within the ISIS L3 hierarchy, 
                      and for all other prefixes in L1 and L2 LSPs. (default) 
              Down (1)-used when an L1/L2 router advertises L2 prefixes in L1 LSPs. 
            The prefixes are being advertised from a higher level (L2) down to a lower level (L1). 
          type: string
          enum:
          - up
          - down
