      description: >-
        The request to retrieve Neighbor Discovery entries per IPv6 interface.
      type: object
      properties:
        ipv6_names:
          description: >-
            The names of IPv6 interfaces for which ND entries will be retrieved.
            If no interface names are specified then the result set will contain all ND entries.

        column_names:
          description: >-
            The list of column names that the returned result set will contain.
            If the list is empty then all columns will be returned.
            The column ipv6_name will always be present in the returned result set.

        A container for Neighbor Discovery entries.
      type: object
      properties:
        resolved:
          description: >-
            Contains the Neighbor Discovery entries where link-layer address of the neighbor is already known.
          type: array
          items:

    Nd.Entry:
      description: >-
        Neighbor Discovery entry. A per neighbor information for IPv6 interfaces, learned through NDP.
      type: object
      properties:
        ipv6_name:
          description: >-
            The name of the IPv6 interface.
          type: string
        neighbor_ip:
          description: >-
            The IPv6 address of the neighbor node.
          type: string
          format: ipv6
        link_layer_address:
          description: >-
            The link-layer address of the neighbor node.
            For an unresolved ND entry, value will be either empty or set to default MAC address.
