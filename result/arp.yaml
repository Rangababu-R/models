        The request to retrieve ARP entries per IPv4 interface.
      type: object
      properties:
        ipv4_names:
          description: >-
            The names of IPv4 interfaces for which ARP entries will be retrieved.
            If no interface names are specified then the result set will contain all ARP entries.

            The list of column names that the returned result set will contain.
            If the list is empty then all columns will be returned.
            The column ipv4_name will always be present in the returned result set.

    Arp.Entry:
      description: >-
        ARP entry. A per neighbor information for IPv4 interfaces, learned through ARP.
      type: object
      properties:
        ipv4_name:
          description: >-
            The name of the IPv4 interface.
          type: string
        neighbor_ip:

            The IPv4 address of the neighbor node.

          format: ipv4
        link_layer_address:
          description: >-
            The link-layer address of the neighbor node.
            For an unresolved ARP entry, value will be either empty or set to default MAC address.
