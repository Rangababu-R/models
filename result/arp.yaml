    Arp.Entries.Request:
      description: >-
        The request to retrieve ARP entries for IPv4 interface(s).
      type: object
      properties:
        ipv4_names:
          description: >-
            The names of IPv4 interfaces for which ARP entries will be retrieved.
            If no interface names are specified then the result set will contain all ARP entries for all available IPv4 interfaces.
          type: array

            Name of the columns (as list), that will present in the returned result set.
            If the column names is empty then all columns will be returned.
            The column ipv4_name (the name of the IPv4 interface) will always be present in the returned result set.

    Arp.Entries.Response:
      description: >-
        A container for ARP entries.
      type: object
      properties:
        resolved:
          description: >-
            Contains the ARP entries for which link-layer address (MAC) of the neighbor is already known.

    Arp.Entry:
      description: >-
        ARP entry. For an IPv4 interface, a neighbor MAC information as learned through ARP.
      type: object
      properties:
        ipv4_name:
          description: >-
            The name of the IPv4 interface.
          type: string
        neighbor_ip:
          description: >-
            The IPv4 address of the neighbor node.
          type: string
          format: ipv4
        link_layer_address:
          description: >-
            The link-layer address (MAC) of the neighbor node.
            For an unresolved ARP entry, value will be either empty or set to default MAC address.
