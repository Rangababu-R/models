    Port.Port:
      description: >-
        An abstract test port used to associate a unique name with the location
        of a physical or virtual test location.

        Some different types of test locations are:
          - physical appliance with multiple ports
          - physical chassis with multiple cards and ports
          - local interface
          - virtual machine, docker container, kubernetes cluster

        The test port format is implementation specific.
        Use the /results API to determine what formats the implementation 
        supports for the location property.
